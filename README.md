This tutorial guides you through the basic process of reading data and drawing conclusions on that data with python. 
No previous coding knowledge is required. All of the code is already written for you by Ethan!

First, if you haven't already done it, download Anaconda at this link https://www.anaconda.com/download/success
Once set up in Anaconda, navigate to Spyder
To make sure our code can do everything we want it to do, we need to download python packages
    these packages contain special fuctions so we don't have to write all the code ourselves (when done right, coding is very open and collaborative!)
Type into your terminal:
    pip install geopandas
    pip install ____
    etc.

Now that we have everything set up, download the zip file in the GitHub repository (what we're in right now)
Unzip the file. It's okay to leave it in your downloads folder.
In the top right corner of Spyder, click on the file symbol to set your directory to the folder with lab.py in it
In the top left corner of Spyder, click on the file symbol and open lab.py (in the same folder)

There's one more thing we have to do before coding. One of the data files (taxi data) we need was too big to put in this repository.
